# NSS Analyses
Shareable analyses for dealing with National Student Survey data (UK HE sector)


# Data Source
NSS data from previous years can be found on the [Office For National Statistics](https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/student-information-and-data/national-student-survey-nss/) website. 

Data available from ONS may be shared.



# What Data to Use
NSS_taught_all18 gives us data aggregated by teaching provider (not registered body). 
We use sheet NSS1 which also gives us provider and JACS1 level subject breakdown. [Burgess et al, 2018](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0192976) found that a Subject x University interaction made the largest contribution to variation in satisfaction scores over ten years.
